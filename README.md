Hi. this is my progress for myself. I want to make this because I want to see what my performance can go and want to remind me in the future this is what you start from :)

==================================

After 12 days of learning Python with Gemini AI, for me that was pretty good but sometimes I felt myself improved a lot but sometimes is not... BUT at least I know what the output is. And AI helped me a lot when something I don't understand I learned from that. I also try to learning about English and Italian language right now ;)
